# davinted
Davin, Esteban, and Mel collaborate on Davin's TEDx talk. Awesomeness happens.

Dependencies are:

* Processing 2.2 (latest version as of 1/21/2015)
* OpenCV 2.4.10 (latest version as of 1/21/2015) - install OpenCV as a library from within Processing
* oscP5 0.9.9 (latest version as of 2/10/2015) - install oscP5 as a library from within Processing

Note that Esteban uses Processing 1.5 because of compatibility with USB analog video capture. Davin and Mel have no problems with 2.2.x.
